## Issues Fixed During Verification

1. **Console statements**: Removed 3 console.error statements from:
   - NatsObjectStoreWatcher.node.ts (line 210)
   - NatsKvWatcher.node.ts (line 308)
   - NatsConnection.ts (line 131)

2. **Build errors**: Fixed index.ts exports after node renaming

## Recommendations

1. **Version**: Consider updating to 1.0.0 for the official release after the breaking changes
2. **Changelog**: Add a CHANGELOG.md to document the breaking changes
3. **Migration Guide**: Consider adding a migration guide for users upgrading from older versions

## Conclusion

The n8n-nodes-synadia package is **ready for n8n verification** after the minor fixes applied. The code follows all n8n standards and best practices, includes comprehensive documentation and examples, and provides proper error handling and user feedback.

The recent refactoring to rename nodes and remove redundancy actually improves the package by:
- Using proper NATS terminology (subscriber/watcher instead of trigger)
- Reducing complexity by removing redundant nodes
- Making the package easier to maintain

## Breaking Changes Note

Users upgrading will need to update their workflows due to renamed nodes:
- NatsTrigger → NatsSubscriber
- NatsKvTrigger → NatsKvWatcher
- NatsObjectStoreTrigger → NatsObjectStoreWatcher
- Removed: NatsRequestReply, NatsService, NatsServiceReply
